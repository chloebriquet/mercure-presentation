# Mercure Presentation

This is the reveal.js presentation of the [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/) protocol I gave [@HumanTalks](https://github.com/HumanTalks) on 7th February 2020 in Grenoble.

You can find [here](https://github.com/chloebriquet/mercure-demo) the Mercure demo project I developped to illustrate my presentation.
